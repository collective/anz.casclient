1.1 (2015-08-06)
----------------
 - Fixed a problem in Plone 4.3 that forces to cast the resultant username to an
   str before passing it to plone.session for session creation. It's needed to
   cast username which is an unicode type to an str as plone.session does a
   direct concatenation of unicode username and other string types that leads to
   an UnicodeDecode error otherwise. It's needed to address plone.session to do
   not so. Meanwhile, casting the username assumes that there are non ascii
   chars in it [sneridagh]

 - Fixed a problem when used in a Zope/ZEO environment with multiple Zope
   clients. Make it work using the default Plone session factory solved the
   problem. [sneridagh]

 - Clean paster plugins in setup.py [sneridagh]

 - Add an extra validation for CAS2.0 service ticket via SAML. This enables the
   extraction of extra user properties. [sneridagh]
